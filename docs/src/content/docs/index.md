Rool Spaces is a persistent and collaborative environment for organizing objects and their relationships. Build applications where AI operates on a structured world model rather than a text conversation.

## Getting Started

To use Rool, you first need a Rool account. Sign up via the [Console](https://explorer.rool.dev) and familiarize yourself with the environment. Create a few spaces, chat with them, add and remove objects.

The Rool Console is a perfectly valid replacement for AI tools like ChatGPT or Google Gemini: a chat with a powerful memory. But the real power of Rool Spaces comes from building and using apps that leverage them.

Many Rool apps can access the same space. You can create spaces shared between friends, family, your team, or your company.

When you're ready to build your first Rool app, read the [SDK docs](/sdk/) or point your coding agent at them, and you'll have your first app in minutes.
